# üì¨ Gmail Unread Labels Notifier ‚Äì Google Apps Script Automation

This project demonstrates how I discovered and used **Google Apps Script** to quickly automate a personal workflow and solve a real problem with minimal code.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è What Problem Does It Solve?

After organizing my Gmail using labels (tags), I realized I was no longer receiving notifications for some important emails. I asked ChatGPT why and the answer was simple: **Gmail only sends notifications for emails in the inbox**, not for messages automatically filtered into labels.

To solve this, I created a script that checks for **unread emails in specific labels** and sends me an email notification listing them.

### üí° About the Project

Although I'm not a JavaScript expert, I was able to:
- Prompt ChatGPT for a solution.
- Refine and adapt the script to suit my workflow.
- Automate it to run hourly using **time-driven triggers**.

This project is not meant to showcase advanced JavaScript skills, but rather to highlight how powerful, accessible automation can be when using **modern tools** creatively. Even with limited coding knowledge.

Also, You can notice in the code that the messages are in spanish, those can be adjusted as desired, in this case I Preferred Spanish.
